    <p>09.15.22
      <br><br>This week consisted of braindstorming thesis topics.
    I know that I want to mine surrounding the concept of the metaverse.
    I want to build mine on 3D fashion in the metaverse. I am very inspired by digital 3D NFT
    artworks and plan to create something like this using Cinema 4D, Marvelous Designer and Unity. 
    I want to create something cool, but I also want it to communicate something or cause the viewer to think.</br>

  <section>
    <p>09.22.22
      <br><br>I have changed my idea – sort of. Originally, I wanted to work in 3D fashion using Cinema 4D and Unity. 
    I will still be using these programs and I am still heavily inspired by the context that is the metaverse.
  However, I want to instead experiment with architecture in the metaverse. What is 3D architecture in this virtual space?
Moving forward, I will do readings of both architecture and the metaverse to draw a paralell between the two and narrow down on a research question. Let's get it.</br></br>

  <section>
    <p>09.29.22
      <br><br>What is considered architecture in the metaverse? Blockchain, edge computing, infrastructure, AI, extended reality and the underlying code as well as various frameworks makes up this "architecture."
      So, what about the 3D walls, buildings and spaces that are added into the metaverse? Would this be an add-on to the underlying code of architecture or would it simply be redunant? 
      What about the physical contraints as to architecture in the metaverse in relation to that of reality? Designers of one-dimensional, digital-only buildings aren’t constrained by codes, materiality, constructability or even gravity.
      Could architecture be substituted, augmented or paralleled with interactions in the metaverse?

    <!-- week 5 -->
  <section>
    <p>10.13.22
      <br><br>The metaverse has no physics and no limitations. I have decided to create a 3D immersive (or at least I hope) space with a heavy focus on architecture, that the user can nagivate througha website or alternative application. This will either be done through pure code or the use of Unity.</br></br>
